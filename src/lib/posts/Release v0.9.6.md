## Changelog

Only a small number of changes this time. Shout out to Okom for the feedback for the first few things and most of the features and design that have been added since initial release:

- When browsing maps when using the Tag and Contributor fields it no longer tries to auto submit while you are typing. You must press enter for it to actually apply the search.
- When searching in the top search bar the page number wasn't being reset to 0 this has been fixed. To research: should using the searchbar at the top reset all filter parameters(Tag, Contributors, hide 343 assets, etc) or should it leave those.
- The blog slideshow on the main page has been replaced with a simple welcome message describing the site. THought this was more descriptive given the infrequent updates and hopefully makes the site more descriptive to new visitors.
- Add small notification dot to the news icon when there is a new update with changelog.

## What's Next

There are some issues with the mobile design not fitting properly on devices. I am going to slowly work on going through each page and trying to update to make things fit as best as possible when viewed on phones.

I'm commited to continuing to improve Unggoy and making it a great platform for discovering and organizing Halo community content. I'm open to feedback and suggestions on what works and what could be improved with the site.

As always, I appreciate your feedback and suggestions. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvements, don't hesitate to reach out. Your input helps shape the future of Unggoy!
