## Changelog

This release focuses on fixing mobile design issues and improving the mobile experience across the site:

- Fixed asset cards clipping off screen edges on mobile. Browse pages now use a single-column layout on phones for better readability.
- Fixed search bar and filter controls overflowing on small screens. All filters now wrap properly and use full width on mobile devices.
- Fixed content being hidden under the bottom navigation bar. Increased padding and added support for iOS safe areas (notches and home indicators).
- Redesigned the "Add to Playlist" modal for mobile with an expandable filter section. Filters are now hidden behind a toggle button to save screen space.
- Fixed iOS Safari auto-zoom issue when focusing on search inputs. All input fields now use proper font sizes to prevent unwanted zooming.
- Fixed modal scroll issue preventing users from reaching the buttons at the bottom. The modal now properly sizes content to ensure all buttons are accessible.

## What's Next

We'll continue improving the mobile experience with additional design refinements across other pages and components. The site should work smoothly on all devices, but there's always room for improvement.

Additionally, a bugfix to handle creators who have changed their Xbox gamertags. This will ensure creator profiles and content attribution stay up-to-date when gamertags change.

As always, I appreciate your feedback and suggestions. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvements, don't hesitate to reach out. Your input helps shape the future of Unggoy!
