excerpt: Mobile UI improvements with smooth animations and better filter accessibility

## Changelog

This release focuses on improving the mobile experience with smoother animations and better organization of UI controls:

- Fixed asset card 3-dot menu animation on mobile. The menu now smoothly slides up and down instead of popping in and out, matching the behavior of the profile menu for a more polished feel.
- Reorganized filter controls on mobile. The asset type selector has been moved from the main browse view into the filter popup, reducing clutter and making better use of limited screen space. It appears as the first option in the filters, styled consistently with other dropdowns.
- Converted filter popup to slide-up modal on mobile. Instead of appearing as a centered dialog, filters now slide up from the bottom of the screen, providing a more intuitive and touch-friendly interaction that's consistent with other mobile UI patterns throughout the app.
- Fixed several mobile UI polish issues. Resolved sort dropdown label cutoff, adjusted modal positioning to account for the bottom navigation bar, and ensured submit/cancel buttons are fully visible and accessible above the nav bar.

## What's Next

I'm continuing to refine the mobile experience and will be working on additional navigation improvements and performance optimizations. There's also a gamertag filter bug on the backlog that needs attention.

As always, I appreciate your feedback and suggestions. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvements, don't hesitate to reach out. Your input helps shape the future of Unggoy!
