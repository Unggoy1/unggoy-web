I'm excited to announce the release of Unggoy v0.8.0! This update brings several significant improvements to enhance your experience with the site. Let's dive into the key features of this release:

## The New Blog

I've implemented a simple blog to keep you informed about the latest changes, improvements, and features in Unggoy. This blog will serve as your go-to resource for:

- Release notes
- Feature spotlights
- Community updates
- Website Announcements

## Revamped Homepage

I've given the homepage a small rework! The homepage now offers:

- A carousel to see the newest blog posts
- Replaced Trending Maps and Modes sections to filter out 343 made assets
- Added new sections to see new and most favorited playlists

I hope this rework will make it easier to find what community made content the playerbase is currently enjoying.

## Boring (But Important) Legal Docs

Last but not least, I've added legal documentation to ensure transparency on what data I collect and what user generated content I allow on the site:

### Terms of Service

Terms of Service now include:

- Info about our optional account system
- What type of content you are prohibited from posting
- How you can access our service

### Privacy Policy

The Privacy Policy covers:

- Detailed explanation of data collection practices
- Info on what is done with data provided from Microsoft Oauth login
- Info about we don't collect data outside your gamertag and Halo infinite player emblem and service tag

While these documents might not be the most exciting read, they're crucial for maintaining a safe and trustworthy platform for all users.

I'm constantly working to improve Unggoy and provide the Halo community with the best possible experience. I appreciate your continued support and feedback. Happy Halo-ing!
