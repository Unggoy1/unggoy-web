This Update focus on making playlist management more intuitive and efficient. Updates to the site have been slow because outside of complete mobile/tablet support i don't have any ideas for new features. I want to thank Okom for pointing out the confusing nature of creating a playlist. With some of his suggustions, I have reworked the playlist creation to hopefully make things clearer. Let's dive into the updates:

## Redesigned Playlist Creation Flow

Creating playlists is hopefully a smoother experience! When you create a new playlist, you're immediately taken to your playlist page with a big button that will bring up a searchable menu to find maps, modes, and prefabs.

The new flow works like this:
1. Create your playlist with a name, description, and thumbnail
2. Get instantly redirected to your new playlist page  
3. Click the prominent "Add Assets" button to start building your collection
4. Browse and add assets through the improved modal interface

## Playlist Header Redesign

Playlist pages received a complete visual overhaul with a focus on better organization and support for  mobile and tablet devices. The new header design features:

- **Always-visible "Add Assets" button** for playlist owners (no more hidden menus!)
- **Cleaner layout** with better spacing and visual hierarchy
- **Mobile-first design** that looks great on all screen sizes
- **Streamlined action buttons** with clear priorities

The mobile experience is particularly improved, with content that stacks vertically in a logical order and action buttons that remain accessible without overwhelming the interface. The only downside is you need to scroll a bit to see the maps and modes on smaller phones.

## Performance Optimizations

Behind the scenes, I've implemented a series of performance improvements to make Unggoy faster and more responsive. The lag and delay that I noticed appear after v0.9.2 hasn't fully gone away, but i hope the peformance improvements i attempted make a different for people.


## Looking Ahead

I'm commited to continuing to improve Unggoy and making it a great platform for discovering and organizing Halo community content. I'm open to feedback and suggestions on what works and what could be improved with the site.

As always, I appreciate your feedback and suggestions. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvements, don't hesitate to reach out. Your input helps shape the future of Unggoy!

Until next time, and if there isnt any more updates before October I hope to see a bunch of you at HWC this year!
