I'm excited to announce the release of Unggoy v0.8.0! This update brings several significant improvements to enhance your experience with the site. Let's dive into the key features of this release:

## The New Blog

I've implemented a simple blog to keep you informed about the latest changes, improvements, and features in Unggoy. This blog will serve as your go-to resource for:

- Release notes
- Feature spotlights
- Community updates
- Website Announcements

## Revamped Homepage

I've given the homepage a small rework! The homepage now offers:

- A carousel to see the newest blog posts
- Replaced Trending Maps and Modes sections to filter out 343 made assets
- Added new sections to see new and most favorited playlists

I hope this rework will make it easier to find what community made content the playerbase is currently enjoying.

## Boring (But Important) Legal Docs

Last but not least, i've finally added legal documentation to ensure transparency and compliance:

### Terms of Service

Our revised Terms of Service now include:

- Clearer language on user rights and responsibilities
- Updated information on data usage and storage
- Refined dispute resolution procedures

### Privacy Policy

The updated Privacy Policy covers:

- Detailed explanation of data collection practices
- Information on how we protect your personal data
- Your rights regarding your information and how to exercise them

While these documents might not be the most exciting read, they're crucial for maintaining a safe and trustworthy platform for all our users.

We're constantly working to improve Unggoy and provide you with the best possible experience. We appreciate your continued support and feedback. Happy Unggoy-ing!
